# Distillation of blazepose

# abstract 

This is BlazePose Distillation to student model for being lighten. And for getting more clear performance of teacher model.

<b>This is overall stracture</b>


## Hint-Based Distillation
This is kind of Distillation that use teacher model backbon(embedding) output for Distillation.
